Trading Space

You are a space merchant flying between worlds trying to make a living.

Controls:
-Click to interact with buttons
-Left Shift to buy/sell in bulk and fastforward movement

Hints:
-Hover over other stations in the travel map to see the differences in prices.
-You can only fly to stations that are connected with a line.
-Hire Pilots to speed up your ship.
-Hire Engineers to decrease the cost of upgrades
-Upgrade your ship to help you go further, faster, carrying more cargo.

(Also there is a lot of legacy code in there from when the game was based on flying between planets and not stars, but I kept it in because I'm going to keep working on the game.)
