- Alex reluctantly got out of bed. 

*   [Alex asked about Kari] After coming out of her sleepy haze, Alex suddenly remembered the events of last night. She asked where Kari was.
    :grandpa: "He didn't come home last night. Probably sleeping over at Audhumbla's or the JÃ³hannsons. You don't understand, child, our kindred are unafraid of the land. She is far less cruel than the city you live in." 
    Alex was unsatified with that answer and felt horribly guilty. She felt that if Kari wasn't safe, it was her fault.
    :grandpa: "Come downstairs. I've already made breakfast while you slept in. I will be hard at work outside."

Grandfather plopped a plate of oatmeal and a dolop of white stuff Alex didn't reconize onto the table. Alex took a seat at the table as he stared directly at her.

    :grandpa: "Its skyr!"
    Grandfather's face began to turn red.
    :grandpa: "It's like yogurt. Gah!": He threw his hands into the air. :grandpa:"What does your family teach you? How dare they let our culture die like this.":
    He stormed out and Alex felt relieved.

One drawing took her particularly long to decipher. But it soon dawned on her what it was- a map. There seemed to be a path through the mountains that lead to the shore. At the top right of the map was a boat circled in red. :player: "If Kari is anywhere it's there.":

Your heart sinks as you realize Kari really isn't in here. Once again you are lost and alone in the Icelandic wilderness. And now you have to go back to your parents and grandpa empty handed and in huge trouble. 

You finally enter the boat and find a mess of drawings, notes, and trinkets. Kari has fashioned this place into a home, or maybe a studio. From the amount of stuff lying around, you assume he must spend a lot of his time here.

//entry #2: grandpa called a meeting with the kindred to talk about the tourists. (there is grandma/grandpa/kari, cow lady, a third family, and a fourth family) patriarch #3 says we should be open to the tourists, the fishing industry isn't what it was when we started this community. grandpa says this is our land and we need to preserve our way of life. grandma seems uncomfortable but takes his side
//entry #3: grandpa finds out patriarch #3 sold a plot of land near the bay to a guide. he is furious. He told me to stop speaking in english. grandma tried to calm him. i ran off and hid here.grandpa exiled family #3 and gave cow lady and other family an ultimatum - either swear off the tourists or leave the kindred. family #4 follows #3, cow lady stays.
//entry #4: Several months since families were sworn off. Grandpa doesn't let me see #3 and #4 kids anymore. Family not doing well(very little money, supported by cow woman and land?). Grandpa was stubborn but Grandma finally convinced him to hire some fishermen from Dalvik. grandma has been quiet, grandpa has been mean. I've been seeing cow lady and she gives me milk and talks to me about grandpa. 

//important to weave in details about kids in #3 and #4
//maybe family #3 and #4 fish for grandpa and they abandon him to fish for themselves
