TILES!!
The grid runs from A1 to J10

The X axis is letters, the Y axis is numbers

You can input tiles in the following ways:

	^A,1 (this is just the top left tile)
	^A:B,1:2 (this is a 2x2 rectangle in the top left)
	^A,1 ^B,1 ^A,2 ^B,2 (this is read the same as ^)

You can have as many tiles written as you want for a choice, and overlap is okay.
	
	^A:B,1:2 ^A,2:3 (this is okay!!)
